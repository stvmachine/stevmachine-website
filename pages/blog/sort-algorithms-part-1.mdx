Sorting algorithms are a key part of many software systems, helping to organize data efficiently. In this post, we'll take a detailed look at two common algorithms: **Bubble Sort** and **Quicksort**.

## Bubble Sort: The Simplest Sorting Algorithm

Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based algorithm. While it's not the most efficient, it serves as a great introduction to sorting due to its simplicity. The basic idea is to repeatedly step through the list and swap adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

```c++
void bubbleSort(vector<int>& arr)
    {
        int i, j;
        bool swapped;
        for (i = 0; i < arr.size() - 1; i++) {
            swapped = false;
            for (j = 0; j < arr.size() - i - 1; j++) {
                if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                    int temp = arr[j+1];
                    arr[j+1] = arr[j];
                    arr[j] = temp;
                    swapped = true;
                }
            }

            // If no two elements were swapped
            // by inner loop, then break
            if (swapped == false)
                break;
        }
    }
```

### Time Complexity

- **Best Case**: O(n) when the array is already sorted.
- **Worst Case**: O(n²) for a reversed array.
- **Average Case**: O(n²), making it inefficient for large datasets.


## Quicksort

Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a pivot and partitioning the array around it. Quicksort's average-case performance is much better than Bubble Sort, making it a go-to sorting algorithm in practice.

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int partition(vector<int>& arr, int low, int high) {
  
    // Choose the pivot
    int pivot = arr[high];
  
    // Index of smaller element and indicates 
    // the right position of pivot found so far
    int i = low - 1;

    // Traverse arr[;ow..high] and move all smaller
    // elements on left side. Elements from low to 
    // i are smaller after every iteration
    for (int j = low; j <= high - 1; j++) {
        if (arr[j] < pivot) {
            i++;
            swap(arr[i], arr[j]);
        }
    }
    
    // Move pivot after smaller elements and
    // return its position
    swap(arr[i + 1], arr[high]);  
    return i + 1;
}

// The QuickSort function implementation
void quickSort(vector<int>& arr, int low, int high) {
  
    if (low < high) {
      
        // pi is the partition return index of pivot
        int pi = partition(arr, low, high);

        // Recursion calls for smaller elements
        // and greater or equals elements
        quickSort(arr, low, pi - 1);
        quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high);
    }
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5};
    int n = arr.size();
    quickSort(arr, 0, n - 1);
    cout << "Sorted Array\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}

```

### Time Complexity

- **Best Case**: O(n log n), achieved when the pivot is chosen effectively.
- **Worst Case**: O(n²), but this is rare and happens when the smallest or largest element is consistently chosen as the pivot.
- **Average Case**: O(n log n), making it much faster than Bubble Sort for large arrays.


### Conclusion

Both sorting algorithms serve different purposes. While **Bubble Sort** is easier to understand and implement, **Quicksort** is more efficient for practical purposes. In future posts, we will explore other algorithms like Merge Sort and Heap Sort to see how they compare.
