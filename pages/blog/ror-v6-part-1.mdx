The last time that I had done something with RoR was more than five years ago. Let's see what it's different. I'm currently following this great [tutorial][learn-enough]. The first part of this serie is focus on requirements and how to start locally a project on ruby on rails.

## Pre-requisites (iOS)

**1. Install xcode**

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

**2. Install brew**

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://www.learnenough.com/homebrew.sh)"
```

**3. Instal rbenv**

To handle easily multiple environments, we are going to use `rbenv`.

```bash
brew install rbenv
```

**3.1 Add rbenv to the PATH**

Load rbenv automatically by appending the following to `~/.bash_profile`:

```bash
eval "$(rbenv init -)"
```

Later on, you can activate inmediately rbenv:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

**3.2 Install target version**

For version 6 of Ruby on Rails is recommended `ruby>=2.6`.

```bash
rbenv install 2.6.6
rbenv rehash        # Installs shims for all Ruby executables known to rbenv
rbenv global 2.6.6  # Set global version
```

**3.3 (Optional) Configuring to skip the installation of Ruby documentation.**

```bash
\$ echo "gem: --no-document" >> ~/.gemrc
```

With that configuration, any uses of gem install `<gem name>` to install Ruby gems will automatically be svelte, streamlined, and documentation-free.

**4. Install yarn**

Internally Ruby on Rails requires yarn.

```bash
brew install yarn
```

**\*5. Install heroku (optional)**
This step is optional. But, it gives a good glimpse of how easy is to deploy to production and it's good to take notice about differences between environments. Especifically, due the default database is sqlite.

```bash
brew tap heroku/brew && brew install heroku
```

## Install Ruby on Rails

```bash
gem install rails -v 6.0.3.4
```

That would generate a `Gemfile`. We have some fixed versions for `ruby` and `rails`, so it should have at least these dependencies:

```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"
git_source(:github) { |repo| "https://github.com/#{repo}.git" }

ruby "2.6.6"
gem "rails", "6.0.3.4"
```

## Start a new project

It's possible to create a new project specifying a specific rails version:

```bash
rails _6.0.3.4_ new project_name
```

This command will generate the following file structure:

| File/Directory   | Purpose                                                                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **app/**         | Core application (app) code, including models, views, controllers, and helpers      |
| **app/assets**   | Applications assets such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and images                 |
| **bin/**         | Binary executable files                                                             |
| **config/**      | Application configuration                                                           |
| **db/**          | Database files                                                                      |
| **doc/**         | Documentation for the application                                                   |
| **lib/**         | Library modules                                                                     |
| **log/**         | Application log files                                                               |
| **public/**      | Data accessible to the public (e.g., via web browsers), such as error pages         |
| **bin/rails**    | A program for generating code, opening console sessions, or starting a local server |
| **test/**        | Application tests                                                                   |
| **tmp/**         | Temporary files                                                                     |
| **README.md**    | A brief description of the application                                              |
| **Gemfile**      | Gem requirements for this app                                                       |
| **Gemfile.lock** | A list of gems used to ensure that all copies of the app use the same gem versions  |
| **config.ru**    | A configuration file for Rack middleware                                            |
| **.gitignore**   | Patterns for files that should be ignored by Git                                    |

## Run server

Then, the only missing part is hit the command to run the server: `rails server`.

## Run the project on Heroku

Ruby on Rails and Heroku are buddies and it is easy to use them together but it is necessary to modify the gem `sqlite3` due Heroku doesn't support SQLite database:

```ruby:Gemfile
group :production do
  gem 'pg', '1.2.3'
end

group :development, :test do
  # other gems
  gem 'sqlite3', '1.4.2'
end
```

Now, it's recommended to install just the necessary gems to each environment, in development we need:

```bash
bundle install --without production
```

Let's create the project in Heroku

```bash
heroku create
```

And let's push the project to keroku:

```bash
git push heroku master
```

## Shortcuts

> There are some shortcuts for each command.

| Full command     | Shortcut   |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| `rails server`   | `rails s`  |
| `rails console`  | ` rails c` |
| `rails generate` | ` rails g` |
| `rails test`     | `rails t`  |
| `bundle install` | ` bundle`  |
