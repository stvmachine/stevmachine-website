## Objects

An object can be understable as entity that stores an internal state and has methods that allows to interact with them and between them.

```ruby
class User
    def initialize(age)
        @age = age
    end
    def can_vote?
        @age > 18
    end
end
```

The method `initialize` is called by default when we initializes an instance:

```ruby
ruby> john = User.new(48)
#<User:0x00007fcc0867b0c0 @age=48>
ruby> john.can_vote?
=> true
```

In this case `john` has 48 years and he can vote.

## Add multiple methods

If an object is already defined, to re-defined the object with more methods is just going to extend the actual definition of the object. If the method is the same that one already defined, in that case is going to replaced:

```ruby
# First definition of User
class User
    def initialize(age)
        @age = age
    end
end

# Adding a new method to User
class User
    def can_vote?
        @age > 18
    end
end
```

Let's create a new user like the last example, the result should be the same:

```ruby
ruby> john = User.new(48)
#<User:0x00007fcc0867bef3 @age=48>
ruby> john.can_vote?
=> true
```

## Methods

A method is named by convention in `snake_case` format and they always returns something even if the word `return` is not used, for convention the returned value is always the last line.

```ruby
def this_return_a_number
    3
end

def this_return_a_number_with_return
    return 3
end
```

```ruby
# without return
ruby> this_returns_a_number
=> 3

# with return
ruby> this_return_a_number_with_return
=> 3
```

### Using Optional Arguments

```ruby
def greet(name, formal=true, shout=false)
    greeting = if informal then "hi" else "hello" end
    message = "#{greeting} #{name}"
    if shout
        message.upcase
    else
        message
    end
end
```

```ruby
ruby> greet("Jake the dog", false, true)
=> "HELLO JAKE THE DOG"
```

But this notation is not obvious of what the arguments means, that forces to check the docs or the definition of the method.

### Named parameters

A more clever way to declare the parameters is **named parameters**. The notation uses colon `<VARIABLE_NAME>:` e.g.:

```ruby
def greet(name, formal: true, shout: false)
    greeting = if informal then "hi" else "hello" end
    message = "#{greeting} #{name}"
    if shout
        message.upcase
    else
        message
    end
end
```

So, this notation is more clear:

```ruby
ruby> greet("Jake the dog", formal: false, shout: true)
=> "HELLO JAKE THE DOG"
```

Let's try more examples:

```ruby
ruby> merge([1,2,3], [4,5,6])
```

In this case is not clear which one is the array that is going to be merge into the other one. So, a more "dev-friendly" solution could be:

```ruby
ruby> merge( from: [1,2,3], to: [4,5,6])
```

Another example, let's assume that exists `setup_user` and it requires a long list of parameters. Situations like this one is more understable and readable if we name all the parameters.

```ruby
def setup_user("john", "John", 1001, true, "/home/john", "users" )

setup_user(login: "john",
    name: "John",
    uid: 1001,
    generate_password: true,
    homedir: "/home/john",
    group: "users")

```

## Duck Typing ðŸ¦†

> If if walks like a duck
> and quacks like a duck
> it probably is a duck

Ruby doesn't really care about classess like other languages (C, Typescript).

Let's say we want to get the name of an object, if the object has the User type then we can be sure that it's going to have the method name, but in Ruby normally you just asks directly if the object has the method; _if it quack?_ not _if it is duck?_.

```ruby
def print_info(obj)
    if obj.respond_to?(:name) # if it quack?
        obj.name
    else
        obj.to_s
    end
end

# This option is not usually used
def print_info_alternative(obj)
    if obj.class == 'User' # if it is duck?
        obj.name
    else
        obj.to_s
end
```

## Attributes

To define attributes in classes is necessary to specify a method to read, otherwise, the property is hidden.

In the next example:

| Property | Reader method | Writer method |
| -------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| @age     | age           | age           |

```ruby
class User
    def initialize(age)
        @age = age
    end

    def age
        @age

    def name(name)
        @name= name
    def name
        @name
end
```

There is a shortcut to define properties that can be readable or writable or both:

```ruby
# option 1
class User
    attr_reader :name, :age,
    attr_writer :name
end

# option 2
class User
    attr_accessor :name
    attr_reader :age
end

```

## Conclusion

In this post we learned:

- An object is an entity that stores an internal state and communicates with other objects through methods.
- To differentiate _methods_ from _objects_ there is a convention to name **methods** in `snake_case` and **objects** in `CamelCase`.
- Is a good practice uses **named parameters** when the methods uses optional parameters or it needs too many parameters as input.
- The _attributes_ of an object are _methods_ that allows to read the internal values.
- There are shortcuts to describe the attributes: `attr_reader`, `attr_writer` and `attr_accesor`.
- We still doesn't cover inheritance of classes and the difference with modules (Soon)
