## Pre-requisites

```bash
npm install serverless -g
```

## Step 1: Let's create a Node.js serverless project

```
$ serverless create --template aws-nodejs --path candidate-service --name candidate
```

This will create the directory `candidate-service` with the following structure:

```
.
├── .npmignore
├── handler.js
└── serverless.yml
```

Let's look at each of these three files one by one.

- `.npmignore`: This file is used to tell npm which files should be kept outside of the package.
- `handler.js`: This declares your Lambda function. The created Lambda function returns a body with `Go Serverless v1.0! Your function executed successfully!` message.
- `serverless.yml`: This file declares configuration that Serverless Framework uses to create your service. serverless.yml file has three sections — provider, functions, and resources.
  - provider: This section declares configuration specific to a cloud provider. You can use it to specify name of the cloud provider, region, runtime etc.
  - functions: This section is used to specify all the functions that your service is composed off. A service can be composed of one or more functions.
  - resources: This section declares all the resources that your functions use. Resources are declared using AWS CloudFormation.

## Step 2: Create a REST resource

Let's update the `serverless.yml` to handle POST to `/candidates`:

```yml
service: candidate-service

frameworkVersion: "2"

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs12.x

functions:
  candidateSubmission:
    handler: api/candidate.submit
    memorySize: 128
    description: Submit candidate information and starts interview process.
    events:
      - http:
          path: candidates
          method: post
```

Then, we refactor a bit the file structure and we rename `handler.js` to `api/candidate.js`. Inside of this file, we define our functions, in this case `candidate.submit`:

```js
"use strict";

module.exports.submit = (event, context, callback) => {
  const response = {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({
      message: "Go Serverless v1.0! Your function executed successfully!",
      input: event,
    }),
  };

  callback(null, response);
};
```

We are ready to deploy:

```
sls deploy
```

Service Information
service: candidate
stage: dev
region: us-east-1
stack: candidate-dev
resources: 11
api keys:
  None
endpoints:
  POST - https://3hlhmtm7cf.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/candidates
functions:
  candidateSubmission: candidate-dev-candidateSubmission
layers:
  None
```

Now, POST operation of your service is available. You can use tools like cURL to make a POST request.

```bash
curl -X POST https://3hlhmtm7cf.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/candidates
```

```
{"message":"Go Serverless v1.0! Your function executed successfully!", "input":{...}}
```
