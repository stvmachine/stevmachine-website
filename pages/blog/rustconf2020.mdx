# Overview

In my opinnion, this online conference was one of the best that I assisted on this year. The speakers were really acertive on their attempt to engage and attract more people to their community. Even I don't really have experience in Rust before the conferece, gave me the initial push to learn, ask questions and probably the most important to feel genuine interest.

I've been hanging around the Rust's slack community channel frequently looking for ideas to start a new project in Rust. I also bought a t-shirt that I don't have a chance to wear yet, but I'm really impressed that they arranged it too.

# The best talks

### Bending the Curve: A Personal Tutor at Your Fingertips by Esteban Kuber
> Rust is a language known for speed and security kept behind a hard learning curve, caused by one of its unyielding goals of being a flexible systems language. By taking teachings > from other domains and understanding the design constraints of the language semantics are not the entirety of the UX of a compiler, it manages to also empower everyone to build > reliable and efficient software without compromises. Lets have a conversation with rustc.

Excellent explanation of why creating a language like Rust and why developers should expect more from their compilers.

### Closing Keynote by Si√¢n Griffin
Crazyness case that exposes how the MissingNo bug in Pokemon can be easily solved with Rust. Incredible fun and engaging!.

# Other good talks

### Error handling Isn't All About Errors by Jane Lusby
> Error handling in rust is incredibly diverse and constantly evolving. As such it is often a source of confusion for new and experienced rustaceans alike. This talk aims to clarify > what error handling in rust means, the patterns that exist, when to apply them, and what libraries currently exist to help with the task.

Excellent talk!. Does a great job of hitting the most important points about error handling. Due the focus of Rust to be bullet-proof, this should be mandatory to reach a mid level on Rust.

### My First Rust Project: Creating a Roguelike with Amethyst by Micah Tigley
I really like this talk because among the incoming community it is always difficult to find a suitable project to start working on Rust. The speaker found a good case and presented it in a way that is very easy to understand for developers with experience with objects such as Javascript.

Not sure about the format of the next year but I will do my best to assist again!.
