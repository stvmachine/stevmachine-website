There are two main elements that we cover in this post: an enhanced pass/fail reporter ([Minitest reporters](#setup-minitest-reporters)), and an automated test runner that detects file changes and automatically runs the corresponding tests ([Guard](#automated-tests-with-guard)).

### Setup minitest reporters

Although many systems will show the appropriate colors for red and green test suites, adding minitest reporters lends a degree of pleasant polish to the test outputs.

Ensure that you have the next gems on your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
  gem 'minitest', '5.14.2'
  gem 'minitest-reporters', '1.3.8'
```

```ruby:test/test_helper.rb
# Other code

# Add the next two lines
require "minitest/reporters"
Minitest::Reporters.use!

class ActiveSupport::TestCase
  .
  .
end
```

### Automated tests with Guard

Guard monitors changes in the filesystem so that only tests that could be affected are runned again.

Ensure that you have the next gems on your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
  gem 'guard', '2.16.2'
  gem 'guard-minitest', '2.4.6'
```

Initializes `Guard`:

```bash
bundle exec guard init
```

Then, select a config for the `Guardfile`, my suggestions is use the recommended by [Learn Enough](https://github.com/mhartl/sample_app_6th_ed/blob/master/Guardfile):

Then, run `guard` to automatically run tests when it detect changes in the project files.

```bash
bundle exec guard
```
