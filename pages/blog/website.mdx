summary: "I create my own website using Next.js + MDX blogging experience."
---

I created this website, because i always desire to have a portfolio but also a way to display the code that i normally work. That code usually just hit my github account. But i really want to keep working on my own stuff and feel rewarded with my progress.

I used a [free template](https://github.com/tbakerx/react-resume-template). But, i decided from the beginning that i want to use some techs on top and remove CSS and jQuery completely. My selected technologies:

- [NextJS][next-js]
- [Theme-ui][theme-ui]
- [Chakra-ui][chakra-ui]
- [Emotion][emotion]
- [MDX][mdx]

I initially did it with `theme-ui` but later i found `chakra-ui` that has some components that i prefered. So, for the moment, i have two themes to handle both website and the blog part. My plan is to migrate completely to `chakra-ui` but keep two themes anyways.

# MDX Support

The MDX support is essential to me because i decided to start a blog too and i did some research and with that format, it will allow me to create and publish new articles easily, as well as improve maintainability over time. I decide to add some plugins that would allow me to add some extra info like `next-mdx-enhanced`. So, some info date or title can be added as:

```
---
layout: 'docs-page'
title: '2019 Year in Review'
publishedAt: '2019-12-26'
summary: 'Highlights and reflections on 2019 and a look forward to 2020.'
---
```

And later, that data can be easily tracked:

```js
import React from "react";

export default (frontMatter) => {
  return ({ children }) => (
      <>
        <h1>{frontMatter.title}</h1>
        {children}
      </>
    );
  };
};
```

# Particular challengues

## Nav menu

The list of our Menu Titles (Sections) as keys, with their _Y-pixel_ position on the page as the values 'home' generically references the top of the page.

```js
const menuItems = {
  home: 0,
  about: null,
  resume: null,
  portfolio: null,
};
```

The next step is determine where to set _Anchor Points_ for each section included on the `menuItems`. The process is basically look for the IDs that match the items on menu. The website contains a layout similar to:

```js
<header id="home" />
<div id="about" />
<div id="resume" />
<div id="portfolio" />
```

The next function scroll down to find each _id_ and it updates `menuItems` with the `Y-pixel`.

```js
const getAnchorPoints = () => {
  const curScroll = window.scrollY - 100;
  for (const key in menuItems) {
    menuItems[key] =
      document.getElementById(key).getBoundingClientRect().top + curScroll;
  }
};
```

Now, we need to add a hook to trigger `getAnchorPoints` when it's necessary. The MutationObserver allows us to watch for a few different events, including page resizing when new elements might be added to the page, potentially changing the location of our anchor points.
We also listen to the scroll event in order to update based on our user's scroll depth.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  // initial run
  getAnchorPoints();

  // run on page resizing
  const observer = new MutationObserver(getAnchorPoints);
  observer.observe(document.getElementById("__next"), {
    childList: true,
    subtree: true,
  });
}, []);
```

## Some extra sugar

To add the active class, I'm using _reactState_.

![alt](/images/blog/website/nav-menu.png)

```js
const [activeItem, setActiveItem] = useState("home");
```

Then, we can define the function `handleScroll`. Iterate through our sections object to find which section matches with the current scrollDepth of the user.

_NOTE_: This code assumes that the sections object is built with an 'ordered' list of sections, with the lowest depth (top) section first and greatest depth (bottom) section last. If your items are out-of-order, this code will not function correctly.

```js
const handleScroll = () => {
    const curPos = window.scrollY;
    let curSection = null;

    if (curPos < menuItems["about"]) {
      curSection = "home";
    } else if (curPos < menuItems["resume"]) {
      curSection = "about";
    } else if (curPos < menuItems["portfolio"]) {
      curSection = "resume";
    } else {
      curSection = "portfolio";
    }
    setActiveItem(curSection);
```

We need to add a hook to detect `scroll`:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  window.addEventListener("scroll", handleScroll);
}, []);
```

## Fade animation

Add some animation to hide the nav menu when we scroll a little but appears again in the second section

```js
const handleScroll = () => {
  const curPos = window.scrollY;
  // other code

  const topSection = menuItems["resume"];
  if (curPos > topSection * 0.2 && curPos < 768) {
    showNav(false);
  } else {
    if (curPos < topSection * 0.2) {
      setNavOpaque(false);
      showNav(true);
    } else {
      setNavOpaque(true);
      showNav(true);
    }
  }
};
```
